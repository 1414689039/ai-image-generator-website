Yes, it is highly recommended to change `FRONTEND_URL` to `https://mileguo.top`.

**Reason:**

1. **Payment Redirects**: This variable determines where users are redirected after a successful payment (`return_url` in `payment.ts`).
2. **User Experience**: If you don't change it, users who access your site via `mileguo.top` will be redirected to `ai-image-generator-frontend.pages.dev` after paying. This domain switch can be confusing and might cause login state issues (since the JWT token stored in LocalStorage on `mileguo.top` won't be accessible on \`pages.
