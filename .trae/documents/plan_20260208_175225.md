I have identified the cause of the issue: your frontend is configured to connect to the default Cloudflare Workers domain (`workers.dev`), which is often blocked or unreliable in mainland China. This explains why you need a VPN to log in and access data.

To resolve this, we need to switch the API connection to your custom domain (`api.mileguo.top`), which should be accessible without a VPN.

### Changes to be made:

1.  **Frontend Configuration (`frontend/.env.production`)**:
    *   Update `VITE_API_URL` from `https://ai-image-generator-worker.a1414689039.workers.dev/api` to `https://api.mileguo.top/api`.
    *   This ensures that when users visit your site, their browser connects to the custom domain instead of the blocked workers.dev domain.

2.  **Backend Payment Callback (`worker/src/routes/payment.ts`)**:
    *   Update the `notify_url` hardcoded in the payment logic to also use `https://api.mileguo.top/api/payment/notify`.
    *   This ensures payment callbacks from ZPay are routed correctly through your custom domain (improving reliability if ZPay servers also have trouble reaching workers.dev).

### Next Steps (after your confirmation):
1.  I will apply the file edits.
2.  You will need to redeploy both the **Frontend** and **Backend** for the changes to take effect.
    *   **Frontend**: `npm run build` and publish to Cloudflare Pages (or let your auto-deployment handle it).
    *   **Backend**: `npm run deploy` (or `npx wrangler deploy`) to update the worker code.

Shall I proceed with editing the configuration files?
