I will implement the following changes to improve the user experience during image generation:

1.  **Allow Clicking on Generating Items**:
    *   Modify `HistoryPanel.tsx` to remove the restriction that prevents clicking on items with `pending` status. This will allow users to select generating tasks and view their status in the preview area.

2.  **Enhance "Generating" Animation in Preview Area**:
    *   Update `PreviewArea.tsx` to handle the `status === 'pending'` case specifically.
    *   Instead of showing the default "Ready to Create" placeholder, it will display a dedicated "Generating" animation.
    *   **Animation Design**: A centered, pulsing AI icon (e.g., Sparkles) with a "Generating..." text and a subtle background glow effect to indicate activity.

3.  **Enhance History Item Animation**:
    *   Update `HistoryPanel.tsx` to give generating items a more distinct visual cue.
    *   Add a pulse effect or a glowing border to the history thumbnails that are in the `pending` state, replacing the simple static loader with a more dynamic visual.

This will resolve the "unclickable" issue and provide the requested visual feedback.
